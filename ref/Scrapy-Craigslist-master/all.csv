I recently purchased a pallet of thousands of old Game Boy Pockets that I want to resell, but I need to test to see if they're all working first, so I don't inadvertently sell broken merchandise.  This product takes 2 AAA batteries, but I don't have time to put in and take out the batteries thousands of times.  Instead, I'd like to build a tabletop (or some other kind of) device that well allow me to test these Game Boy Pockets quickly and easily.

When the game boy is placed on the board, and moved into the correct position so that the battery contacts touch the head of the nails, the circuit is completed, and the game boy turns on.  With this setup, you can simply place each game boy on the board, one at a time, and see if it turns on - no need to mess with batteries!
